   <h1 class="heading"><u>The Hunt For Red October</u></h1>
   <p class="opening">In November of 1984, shortly before Gorbachev came to power, a Typhoon-class Soviet sub surfaced just south of the Grand Banks.<br><br> 
    It then sank in deep water, apparently suffering a radiation problem. Unconfirmed reports indicated some of the crew were rescued. <br><br>
    But, according to repeated statements by both Soviet and American goverments. <br><br>Nothing of what you are about to see... <br><br>
    <i>Ever happened.</i></p><br>

   <p>This was an amazing movie.
   <h3>What I liked</h3>
   Almost all of it.
   <h3>What I didn't like</h3>
   <p>The part about rabbits and two wives wasn't so good. I, as a woman, was waiting for that to be over. I understand the traveling without papers, due to the USSR's government being the way it was, but the two wives and rasing rabbits was unneeded.
